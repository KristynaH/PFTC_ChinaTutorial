Download the repository (ZIP format) to a local path where you want the cloned directory to be made. Then, extract all the ZIP content to a regular folder. 

### 3. Launch the project. 

You must work on "PFTC_tutorials.Rproj" that is located in the main folder of the repo. Just open the project with Rstudio. Working from there allows access to all the code and the scripts will work. Be careful not to change the location of the files within the repo or the scripts will stop working.

### 4. Install required packages

Run the script in "setup.R" to install any extra R package that you need. This only needs doing once. This step is **very important**. The rest of the tutorial will not work if you are missing packages.

### 5. The tutorials

The tutorials are consecutive numbered as 

- 1_RtutorialChina.Rmd
- 2_RtutorialChina.Rmd
- 3_RtutorialChina.Rmd. 

If you want things to keep working, start with number 1, and work in order (first go first, second go second...and so on)

So, to start just open "1_RtutorialChina.Rmd" and the explanations and scripts will guide you. If you have questions we are happy to help.

Enjoy!
